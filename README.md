# 3D-Game-Dev-for-Dummies

This is a repository for learning the basics of 3d game development with Java and LWJGL 3.
Through this course, you will learn game programming, how to use a VCS, and OpenGL.

## What is this?

3D Game Dev for Dummies is essentially a crash course in 3D game development. It is NOT an ideal
learning path, but it will cover the basics as fast as possible.

### Who is this meant for?

Anyone can follow these, but it's mainly meant for 2 groups of people:

1. Intermediate Java programmers who want to get into game development
2. Programmers who use C/C++ that want to use Java

In case you don't know programming, I will briefly cover programming science and Java as well
as provide some resources for learning the language.

### What will I learn?

Throughout all of this, you will learn basic computer programming science, game programming, Java, Git, and
OpenGL. Because OpenGL does not natively support Java, we will use the Lightweight Java Game Library
(LWJGL). Time to complete everything varies, but it can take up to 6 months if you know absolutely nothing.

## Prerequisites

While not much is required beforehand, you should know computer science and the basics of programming beforehand.
Ideally, you should already know Java, but it is not necessary. Keep in mind I will not be explicitly teaching Java.
You will have to learn it on your own time or just learn as we go. Again, little is required beforehand, but you will
be installing the following during this course:

* JDK 8
* An IDE
* Git
* LWJGL 3

The only must in this course is a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.0.

## How to follow the tutorials

The source code in this repository is organized into different sections, with chapters for each lesson. The tutorials themselves
will be located in the wiki. I will also link other people's tutorials in the wiki as well.

## Licensing

All code here is under the MIT license (basically, do whatever).
